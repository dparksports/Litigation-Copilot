Gipson claims that the defendants violated his right to due process and other constitutional rights. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that they are entitled to absolute or qualified immunity. The court examines the specific assertions and ultimately grants the motion to dismiss, finding that Gipson has failed to allege any specific facts to overcome the judicial or prosecutorial immunity of the defendants.\n"
